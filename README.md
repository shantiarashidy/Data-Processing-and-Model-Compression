## Project Overview
This project allows users to:
1. Process raw data and save it in a structured format.
2. Detect and handle outliers in the dataset.
3. Export data and results in compressed formats.
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training within Jupyter Notebooks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean raw data, handle missing values, and normalize features.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detect unusual data points for a cleaner dataset.
- **Model Training**: Provide baseline model training for further analysis.
- **File Compression**: Save all results in a single compressed zip file for easier sharing.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```plaintext
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
zipfile38
